# Ohm's Law model

This document describes the model for the Ohm's Law simulation.<br>

The model describes the current of a straight ohmic wire. I is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, 
V is the voltage measured across the conductor in units of volts, and R is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms.
More specifically, Ohm's law states that the R in this relation is constant, independent of the current. This simulation's
model is simple. It represents this formula.

The Formula is
I= V/R or
Current = Volts / Ohms
